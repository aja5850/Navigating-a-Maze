# Navigating-a-Maze

DESCRIPTION

The goal of this project is to navigate a virtual ant through a maze. The program reads from a text file that lists (in no particular order) a set of 
instructions for the ant to move. These instructions are defined as functions in an ADT, in this case specifically a stack. The position of the ant is defined as x and
y. The ant does not know its physical location, it can however "remember" a set of moves that it executed. Functions such as "MOVE_L" and "MOVE_R" change the position
of the ant, whereas functions such as "push" and "pop" allow the ant to "remember" its previous moves. The functions are then executed in a main file, which also reads the text file that contains the instruction for the ant.
