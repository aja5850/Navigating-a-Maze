# Navigating-a-Maze

DESCRIPTION

This project uses an ADT, specifically a stack, that stores various functions that will help navigate a virtual ant through a maze. The main program reads a set of
instructions from a text file. That text file contains functions (in any order) that were described in the stack. The physical position of the ant is described as x andy.
